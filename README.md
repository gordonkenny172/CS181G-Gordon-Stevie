# Preliminary Notes

We began this project by first building our games and then extracting the common infrastructure used in each of our games. We first built the fighter game, then the puzzle game, and finally the adventure game. Then we built our engine using our final adventure game codebase. There will be improvements in code and
changes in the way we organized our code base from game to game which will make more sense with this task order in mind.
